# Calculator aka "Calculatron"

The objective of this project was to make a simple calculator which allowed the user to add, substract, multiply, and divide while updating the display after each operation.

User controls for what's visible are provided, as well as some controls for the speed of background animations.

Keyboard support is included for the calculator and controlling visual elements. A left nav contains these controls in addition to a list of available keyboard shortcuts.

Overall, it's just a little calculatorâ€¦ *beep* *boop* *beep!*
